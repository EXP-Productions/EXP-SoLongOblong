Note: Delete the bin folder before doing a live build. These are only used in the editor and only for X-Change3D

v.1.8
A lot of bug fixes. Added external saving. Each export now goes into it's own folder (Named by Date and Time). Fixed the diffuse color and transparency. Added scaling option.

SkinnedMesh export will not be supported as FBX SDK doesn't export the conversion of the XML which was the orgiinal code base for X-Change but caused too many problems. Conversion is now based on Wavefront OBJ format and conversion is through the FBX SDK 2015
OSX is still not supported, although it's being added back into the code base. Once I can debug it, it will be officially supported. Try it at your own risk. If you do, please inform mtheory of any bugs.
